# Unreal C++ Reference

I primarily work as a tools focused tech artist but I come from an art/tech art background rather than an engineering one. Unreal and DCC apps tend not to fully document all the features available to develop tools with so I am documenting what I find that works.

# Notes:

- These examples are meant more as a guide than anything, some may compile immediately, some may require some other code/files/structure. If I have time, I may go in and restructure the whole depot as a project that can be loaded/compiled so that its easier to understand in context.
- I try to document the code as I go, if anyone finds anything confusing feel free to poke me and I will try to clarify.
- If you have good examples that you think may fit well here, feel free to open a pull request.
